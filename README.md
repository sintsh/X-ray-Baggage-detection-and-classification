# X-ray-Baggage-detection-and-classification


Nowadays security and privacy is becoming a crucial thing in different private
and governmental institutions. Therefore in order to ensure employee and cus-
tomer security organizations, embassies, hotels, banks, universities and other
centers use various mechanisms for the public safety. An X-ray scanner machine
can be mentioned as one of these methods. X-ray scanners are used in security
checks to see if there is anything prohibited in a passenger bag. However, it is
very difficult to identify every object found inside a bag with only the human
eye. Thus security inspectors struggle to detect prohibited objects that pose a
serious hazard to the public. [1] And this procedure not only affects the secu-
rity but also requires a significant amount of time and manpower. We believe
that the application of computer vision and deep learning can help identify the
objects in a baggage by taking the image from the X-ray machine.
